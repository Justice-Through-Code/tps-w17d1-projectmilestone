Handling Demo Failures and Q&A

Objective: Learn strategies for gracefully handling technical issues during demonstrations.

Common Demo Failures and Recovery Strategies:

"Let's practice handling common demo problems:"

1. API/Network Failures
    Have cached/mock data ready
    Explain what should happen
    Show screenshots if needed
Example Recovery: "It looks like the weather API is having issues. Normally, this would show real-time data for any city. Here's what it looked like earlier today..." shows screenshot

2. Feature Crashes
    Stay calm and acknowledge it
    Explain the feature's purpose
    Move to the next feature smoothly
Example Recovery: "Interesting! This feature seems to be having an issue. What this does is analyze temperature trends over time. Let me show you the visualization component instead..."

3. Performance Issues
    Acknowledge and explain the cause
    Show the feature anyway if possible
    Mention optimization plans
Example Recovery: "The application is running a bit slowly because it's processing 10 years of historical data. In the final version, this will be optimized. Let's see the results..."

4. Missing Features
    Don't demo what doesn't exist
    Briefly mention as future work
    Focus on what IS working
